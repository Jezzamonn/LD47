# Phone Tree of Despair - Walkthrough

## Introduction

First, call and wait on the line. You'll hear information about the game, and get the extension code of the registration office: 111.

At the main menu, enter the code 111 to get to the registration office. They'll ask you your name. They will get it wrong, but when asked if that's correct you must say "yes" anyway.

Then they will ask you for the three things you need to renew your registration:

1. Your registration ID
2. Your registration office address
3. The date of your last renewal

You don't know any of those yet, so you can enter something wrong or just wait. You'll be given the extension of the extension directory: 123.

After calling the extension directory, you'll get the extensions of 3 new departments:

- The ID department: 575
- The addressing department: 818
- The International Date Time Zone Consortium: 3?3 (static noise covers the middle digit).

## Getting your registration ID

The ID department will first ask your name. You can't use your real name, but perhaps there's another name you could use...

You'll need to use the name that you were incorrectly called from the registration office.

After giving your name, the operator will casually mention some information about your account. Then they'll ask you some information to identify you -- the same information they just mentioned! Note down the numbers when they're first said, and repeat them back to get your ID.

## Getting your registration office address

When you call the addressing office, the operator will be on lunch break. You need to tell the operator "no", that it cannot wait.

The operator will then ask you to help with the crossword. The clues should be fairly straight forward, but if you get stuck, the answers are:

- Coffee
- Oxygen
- Silent

After calling that, you'll get... the extension code of the real office you need to call.

When you call new extension, you'll have to look up the postal codes of a few places. If you struggle with the names of the places, they are:

- Antelope Hills, Wyoming
- Kathu, South Africa
- White Cliffs, New South Wales, Australia

Google maps should be able to help you there.

If you're struggling to find the postal codes, they are:

- 82601
- 8446
- 2836

After answering all that, you'll get the postal office address.

## Getting the date of your last renewal

First you'll need to figure out the extension of the The International Date Time Zone Consortium. You know all the digits but one, so you should be able to figure it out with trial and error.

The machine will give you the date you need, but as a unix timestamp. If you look up unix timestamp converter, you should be able to convert it back to a date. With different timezones around the world, that time could be two possible days, but the system did tell which day of the week it was.

## Renewing your registration

With those three pieces of information, you can new renew your registration!

You'll need to enter the 3 pieces of information you got earlier. If you had trouble, or want to skip there, the numbers are:

- Registration ID: 54002
- Registration office address: 56789
- Registration date: 20191126 (that is, 2019-11-26).

After all that, you can finally renew your registration!!

## Killing the machine!

There is a secret way to defeat the machine! I won't reveal the whole solution, but it involves an option in the final conversation, after you're renewed your registration.

## Bob's office

If you enter the extension 'DOG', you'll get to Bob's office. That's all.
