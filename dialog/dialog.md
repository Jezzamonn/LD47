# More info

Once again, welcome to the Phone Tree of Despair. This is a game made for loo dum dar ray 47 by Jez Swanson.
First, some disclaimers. While this game sometimes uses your voice as input, it does not save any voice recordings. It also does not store your phone number.
In this game, you'll navigate a state-of-the-art, user-friendly phone system. Your goal is to renew your registration.
Your first stop should be the registrations office. To get there, type the extension code 1 1 1 at the main menu.
One last thing. You do not want to be put on hold. If you get put on hold, you'll be forever stuck in a loop. So if you hear hold music, you should hang up and try calling again.
Alright, good luck!

## Registration

Welcome to the registration office. May I have your name?

I got "Kevin Lee", is that correct?

I got "James Smith", is that correct?

I got "Mary Smith", is that correct?

I got "Maria Garcia", is that correct?

Great. It looks like you're trying to renew your registration. I'll need three things from you: Your registration ID, your registration office address, and the date of your last renewal.
First, key in your 5 digit registration ID.

Ok. Now key in the 5 digit postal code for the registration office.

Ok. Now key in the date of your last renewal. First enter the year, then the month, then the day.

Alright, that all looks correct! Your registration is now renewed.
Before you leave, can you rate your customer experience today? Please enter a number from 1 to 5.

Thank you for your rating.

Congrations, you have killed the automated voice service!
