# More info

Once again, welcome to the Phone Tree of Despair. This is a game made for loo dum dar ray 47 by Jez Swanson.
First, some disclaimers. While this game sometimes uses your voice as input, it does not save any voice recordings. It also does not store your phone number.
In this game, you'll navigate a state-of-the-art, user-friendly phone system. Your goal is to renew your registration.
Your first stop should be the registrations office. To get there, type the extension code 1 1 1 at the main menu.
One last thing. You have to avoid getting put on hold. If you get put on hold, you'll be forever stuck in a loop. So if you hear hold music, you should hang up and try calling again.
Alright, good luck!

## Registration

Welcome to the registration office. May I have your name?

I got "Kevin Lee", is that correct?

I got "James Smith", is that correct?

I got "Mary Smith", is that correct?

I got "Maria Garcia", is that correct?

Great. It looks like you're trying to renew your registration. I'll need three things from you: Your registration ID, your registration office address, and the date of your last renewal.
First, key in your 5 digit registration ID.

Ok. Now key in the 5 digit postal code for the registration office.

Ok. Now key in the date of your last renewal. First enter the year, then the month, then the day.

Alright, that all looks correct! Your registration is now renewed.
Before you leave, can you rate your customer experience today? Please enter a number from 1 to 5.

Please enter a number from 1 to 5.

Please, please enter a number from 1 to 5.

Congrations, you have killed the automated voice service!

Thank you for your rating.

Sorry, that doesn't look correct. If you need to look up information about your registration, try contacting the other departments. You can find their extension codes by accessing the extension directory by pressing 1 2 3 at the main menu. I'll transfer you there now.

Sorry about that. Please hold.

## Epilog

This was Phone Tree of Despair, a game made for Ludum Dare 47. I hope you enjoyed it! Or alternatively, I hope it made you very, very angry.

You managed to renew your registration, although the phone system lives on to terrorise future victims.

Not only did you manage to renew your registration, but you also killed the phone system! May you be hailed as a hero for generations to come.

I'm Jez Swanson, known as jezzamonn on twitter. If you entered Ludum Dare, please give the game a rating on the Ludum Dare website. You can find the link at jezzamon dot itch dot io. Congrats again on winning! Good bye!

## Address

Hi, this is the addressing office. I'm currently on lunch break actually, is this something that can wait?

Ok great. I'll put you on hold.

No? Ok, well, I'm almost done with this crossword. If you could help me with the last few clues, then I should be able to help you with your problem.

Alright, let's see... 16 Down. A 6 letter word for "coffee", starts with a C.

*(this the response when the user enters a wrong answer)*
Hm, no, that's not it. Let me put you on hold while I think about it.

*(this the response when the user takes too long to enter an answer)*
Not sure? Yeah me neither. Let me put you on hold while I think about it.

Coffee! That it! Ok, 3 Across. Baby feline. 6 letters.

Yup, kitten fits. Next one: 4 Down. Element with 8 electrons. 6 letters.

Oxygen fits! Ok, last one: 1 Across. Another word for quiet. 6 letters long, the second letter is 'I' and the third letter is 'L'.

Silent! Of course! Ok, that's all of them! Now, lets take a look at your problem.

Hm... Oh, are you trying to find the address of your registration office? We don't do that here. This is the addressing office, for writing names and addresses on envelopes. If you want the find the address of your registration office, you'll need to call Sam on the extension 828.
Alright, well thanks for your help with the crossword! Have a nice day.

## Registration Office Address

Hi, you've reached the "what is the address of my registration office" department. Now, you're gonna have to be patient, 'cause we're having some database problems at the moment. Um... actually would you mind helping? I need you to look up the postal code of a few places. Um, lets start with Antelope Hills, Wyoming, USA. Can you key in the ZIP code?

*(this the response when the user enters a wrong answer)*
Ok... Er, looks like the system crashed. I guess that wasn't right. Let me- let me put you on hold and I'll try rebooting it.

*(this the response when the user takes too long to enter an answer)*
Oh sorry, the system crashed. Let me put you on hold for a second.

Ok.... That looks right. Ok, now I need the postal code of... Kathu, South Africa.

Ok... Great, that worked too. Um. Can you also check the postal code of White Cliffs, New South Wales, Australia?

Ok.... Looks good. Ok, the system is loading. doot do do... Still loading... Ok, it's up! Let me see. Uh... Oh that's right, we only have one office. It's postal code is 5 6 7 8 9. That should be what you need. Oh and the system crashed again. Great. Well, yeah, that's all you need, 5 6 7 8 9. Ok... Bye.

## ID Department

Hi, this is the ID department. We can look up your registration ID here. First, I'll need your name.

Hm, we don't have anything for that name. Maybe you're registered under a different name? Any idea what that would be?

No, nothing for that either. Let me transfer you to our naming department.

Sorry, I didn't catch that. Let me put you on hold.

Ah great, James Smith. (as if reading from the screen) Pin number 2 4 3 8, Session identifier 9 0, Flange-tron code 6 1 2, Isotope number 97 thousand, 6 hundred and 48. Ok great. Now, before I can give you your registration ID, I'll need some information to confirm your identity. First, can I have your personal pin number? Just key it in on the number pad there.

Oh! Sorry, that doesn't look correct. Let me put you on hold, while I... figure out what to do (in background: Gary we got an imposter!)

Ok, now I'll need your Flange-tron code.

Ok, and now your isotope number?

Alright! You are indeed James Smith! Your registration number is 5 4 0 0 2. Have a good day!
