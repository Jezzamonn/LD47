# More info

Once again, welcome to the Phone Tree of Despair. This is a game made for loo dum dar ray 47 by Jez Swanson.
First, some disclaimers. While this game sometimes uses your voice as input, it does not save any voice recordings. It also does not store your phone number.
In this game, you'll navigate a state-of-the-art, user-friendly phone system. Your goal is to renew your registration.
Your first stop should be the registrations office. To get there, type the extension code 1 1 1 at the main menu.
One last thing. You do not want to be put on hold. If you get put on hold, you'll be forever stuck in a loop. So if you hear hold music, you should hang up and try calling again.
Alright, good luck!

## Registration

Welcome to the registration office. May I have your name?

I got "Kevin Lee", is that correct?

I got "James Smith", is that correct?

I got "Mary Smith", is that correct?

I got "Maria Garcia", is that correct?

Great. It looks like you're trying to renew your registration. I'll need three things from you: Your registration ID, your registration office address, and the date of your last renewal.
First, key in your 5 digit registration ID.

Ok. Now key in the 5 digit postal code for the registration office.

Ok. Now key in the date of your last renewal. First enter the year, then the month, then the day.

Alright, that all looks correct! Your registration is now renewed.
Before you leave, can you rate your customer experience today? Please enter a number from 1 to 5.

*(this the response when the user enters a wrong answer)*
Hm, no, that's not it. Let me put you on hold while I think about it.

Not sure? Yeah me neither. Let me put you on hold while I think about it.

Coffee! That it! Ok, 3 Across. Baby feline. 6 letters.

Yup, kitten fits. Next one: 4 Down. Element with 8 electrons. And its 7 letters.

Oxygen fits! Ok, last one: 1 Across. Another word for quiet. 6 letters long, the second letter is 'I' and the third letter is 'L'.

Silent! Of course! Ok, that's all of them! Now, lets take a look at your problem.
