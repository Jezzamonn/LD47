## Phone Tree of Despair

Phone Tree of Despair is a game where you navigate a phone tree while trying to avoid getting stuck on a hold loop. To play this game, you literally call a phone number.

Your goal is to navigate the ~~infuriating~~ expertly designed, user-friendly phone tree to renew your registration! Solve some puzzles along the way, and reflect on how much we all love automated phone systems.

*Warning: This game may frustrate you. It sure frustrated the heck out of me!!* ðŸ˜¡

## How to play:

# Call **+1 (928) 569 9118**.

*Estimated time to completion:* ***30 minutes.***

Note: Because you're making a real phone call, this game may cost you money depending on your phone plan. Watch out for international phone call fees if you're not in the US.

Stay tuned for a browser-based version that doesn't need you to make a call!

## Costs and stuff! ðŸ’¸

This game costs a small amount to host, so if you want to cover costs, you can send a donation of $1 via the [itch.io](https://jezzamon.itch.io/phone-tree-of-despair) page. If not, that's cool too, but if it goes viral I may have to take it down ðŸ˜…
